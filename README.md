# CS-499 - Computer Science Capstone
## Jason Holmes - Professional Self-Assessment
* Discuss how completing coursework/developing the ePortfolio has helped showcase strengths. Address the 5 course outcomes. This should function as an overall introduction to skills.
* Introduce the artifact. Describe what it is and why it was chosen.

## Code Review (and Project Structure)
{% include youtube.html id="blLPAqMX2sw" %}
* Follow up with a summarized assessment of the project and planned enhancements while describing the overall enhancement process.
* Describe the preliminary work that had to be completed before each major category could be addressed. This is where I want to talk about the work that I did in generating database data because while it isn't directly related to enhancing the artifact, I found it interesting and of potential value for the portfolio.

## Artifact Enhancements
* For each of the three major categories of software design & engineering, algorithm & data structures, and databases, include a written narrative describing in detail the enhancements for each category. This can and should be adapted from the submitted milestones after incorporating feedback from the original submissions.
* Each course outcome that is addressed in the enhancement should be presented clearly and explicitly here. I'm thinking of having each category section broken down into an introduction section followed by sections divided and headed by which outcomes they address.

## Course Outcomes
* For each of the 5 major course outcomes, summarize which enhancements addressed the outcome.
